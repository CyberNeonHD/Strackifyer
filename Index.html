        <p>Strackifyer is a website that displays your personal Spotify listening statistics without storing any user information.
          This is a current work-in-progress project, for additional information, see the stages.
          The features listed below are those that will be available on the site in the future.
          This is my first significant project, and I plan to do all in my ability to make the design and features as good as possible.
          Suggestions are always welcome.

          <h2>Top 10 artist</h2>
          <p>Do you want to know which artist you're listening to the most?
            Soon, you'll be able to see your top 10 Spotify artists from the last four weeks, six months, and a year.
            This is a first-stage feature. This will be extended to your top 50 in stage 3!

          <h2>Top 10 Tracks</h2>
          <p>Do you want to know what songs you listen to the most?
            Soon, you'll be able to view your top 10 Spotify tracks from the previous four weeks, six months, and a year. 
            This is a first-stage feature. This will be extended to your top 50 in stage 3!

          <h2>Top 3 albums (beta)</h2>
          <p>Have you ever wondered what your favorite albums are?
            You'll find out soon enough.
            Since Spotify does not provide this information, I must calculate it myself.
            Hence, why it will launch as a beta.
            This will also extend to your top 50 in stage 3!

          <h2>Future features</h2>
          <p>In the later stages, you will be able to check and edit your playlist, check your recent history, and check your upcoming "hot" tracks and artists. Search for
            a specific track, album, or artist and see the specific stats for it and much more.

            <p>Log in to Spotify and look at your top 10 artists and tracks from the last four weeks, six months, and a year.
              You will also be able to see your top 3 albums (beta feature) from the last 4 weeks, 6 months, and last 12 months.
              Since Spotify doesn't provide the data of your top albums, I need to calculate it myself (that's why I will add it in as beta, since there could be errors in the beginning).

            <h2>The start - better design</h2>
            <p>Stage 2 will be primarily focused on thinking about more features, improving the design for showcasing the stats, and cleaning some code and optimizing some code.
              Some more back-end stuff for future implaments.

            <h2>More stats!!</h2>
            <p>Yeah, you read it. Once on stage 3, all "top" stats will go into the top 50. 
              This is also a stage where I prepare a lot of back-end code for stage 4.

            <h2>The drop - extra features</h2>
            <p>This is the moment you've been looking forward to. WOOP WOOP, MORE FEATURES. 
              You'll be able to see and edit all of your playlists (remove and add tracks to them). 
              Searching for tracks and albums (yeah, full albums). There's no need to manually add songs to playlists anymore. 
              Check your recent track history to see what you've been playing. Look up a specific album, artist, or track to see what statistics are available for it. 
              Check out what's coming up in terms of "hot" tracks and artists. This is a formula I did on my own. 
              When you listen to a particular artist and/or song a lot in a short period of time, it becomes "hot", this will be a symbol that appears in your top lists.

            <h2>The finish - but not the end</h2>
            <p>After stage 4, this will be the stage where I optimize and make some more advancements to the features. When this stage is released, I see the site as "fully ready."
              This doesn't mean I will stop supporting it. I will still think about more features to add and, of course, user feedback for more improvements and features.

            <p>
              I'm not sure if this is doable, but I'll see what I can do at this point to add a system to check other data like Youtube music, Amazon music, and Deezer.
