### Strackifyer is a website that displays your personal Spotify listening statistics without storing any user information. This is a current work-in-progress project, for additional information, see the road map. The features listed below are those that will be available on the site in the future. This is my first significant project, and I plan to do all in my ability to make the design and features as good as possible. Suggestions are always welcome.
