### Strackifyer is a website that displays your personal Spotify listening statistics without storing ANY user information. This is a current work-in-progress project, also open source! Suggestions are always welcome.

### REBRAND is happening since V2 is around the corner. Site will be redesigned, with under the hood Sveltekit + Tailwind CSS. The name and domain will also change. Strackifyer will soon be "TunePulse".
