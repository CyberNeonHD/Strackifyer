### Strackifyer is a website that displays your personal Spotify listening statistics without storing ANY user information. This is a current work-in-progress project, also open source! Suggestions are always welcome.

### REBRAND is happening since V2 is around the corner. Site will be redesigned, with under the hood Sveltekit + Tailwind CSS. The name and domain will also change. Strackifyer will soon be "TunePulse".

### Notice about the rebrand:

This project is still one that I want to finish.
The reason for the massive delay is because of college, but also because I learned a lot of new things behind the scenes.
I now have my own server, and strackifyer is already migrated to it.
So, I learned a lot about self-hosting, as well as cloudflare and zero-trust tunnels.
In 78 days (August 2024), the strackifyer domain will be invalid, so I guess you can expect the changes by then.
About V2. It's a big learning curve going into Svelte Kit (my first JS library I learned) and Tailwind CSS.
Other exciting things, I saw that there are some Spotify API updates that create new feature ideas.
Why rebrand? The idea is to release a more mature "solution" with actual theming and great naming.Â
